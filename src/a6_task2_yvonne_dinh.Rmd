## Political and Environmental Self-Identification

#### Introduction
This analysis uses survey data conducted by Chelsea Batavia and the Andrews Forest LTER in August 2017. It explores the association between survey respondents' political affiliation and whether or not they self-identify as an environmentalist. This will be explored through a chi-square test to analyze if the two responses are independent of each other.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#read in data
survey=read.csv(here("data","conservation_survey.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

#keep only the 'ENV_ID' and 'POL_OR' variables
survey_simple=survey %>% 
  select(env_id, pol_or)

#add a new column of political parties and environmental response and get rid of other political affiliations
survey_simple=survey_simple %>% 
  mutate(party=case_when(
    pol_or %in% c("1", "2", "3") ~ "Conservative",
    pol_or %in% c("5", "6", "7") ~ "Liberal")) %>% 
  mutate(envi=case_when(
    env_id %in% c("1") ~ "Yes",
    env_id %in% c("2") ~ "No",
    env_id %in% c("3") ~ "Unsure")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(party))
```

#### Analysis

Table 1: Counts and proportions of liberal and conservative survey respondents to the statement "I consider myself an environmentalist." Data: Andrews et al. (2019)
```{r, warnings = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#create a table that shows counts and proportions of survey results
survey_counts=survey_simple %>% 
  tabyl(party, envi)

survey_table=survey_simple %>%
  tabyl(party, envi) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2) %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  rename ("Political Party" = party) %>% 
  select(1,4,2,3)

#final output kbl table
survey_table %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_material(c("hover"))

```

```{r,echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#convert counts table to a contingency table
survey_ct=survey_counts %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var="party")

#preform a chi-square test
survey_chisq=chisq.test(survey_ct)
survey_tidy=tidy(survey_chisq)

```

#### Summary
A majority of liberal respondents (53.73%, n=281) identified as an environmentalist, while a majority of conservative respondents (50.24%, n=318) did not. After running a $\chi$^2^ test, we find that there is a significant association between survey respondents' political affiliation and whether they identify as environmentalists ($\chi$^2^(`r survey_tidy$parameter`) = `r round(survey_tidy$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r signif(survey_tidy$p.value, 3)`). These results indicate that liberals are more likely to identify as environmentalists than conservatives are.
